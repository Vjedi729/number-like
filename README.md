# Purpose

This package is primarily an interface for objects that work like **numbers with additional functionality** and a function for automatically converting doubles into such classes.

It also contains samples for a few simple, useful number-like classes. Be aware that any of these classes, except the basic `MyNumber` class, may be moved to a separate package in the future.
